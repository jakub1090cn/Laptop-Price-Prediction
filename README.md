# Laptop Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This project is dedicated to predicting laptop prices using regression analysis. It comprises two main components: an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) conducted in a separate Jupyter notebook to visualize and understand the data, and the main analysis notebook where data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation are performed.

## Project Structure
**laptop_price_EDA.ipynb:** An interactive notebook containing Exploratory Data Analysis using plotly.express to visualize the dataset and uncover insights. \
**Project_regression.ipynb:** The main notebook that includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, regression analysis, model evaluation, and overfitting mitigation strategies. \
**laptop_price.csv:** The dataset file containing the features and prices of various laptops.
## Key Features
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Detailed data exploration with interactive visualizations to identify trends and patterns. \
**Data Preprocessing and Cleaning:** Techniques applied to prepare the data for modeling. \
**Feature Engineering:** Transformation and encoding of features to improve model performance. \
**Regression Analysis:** Use of multiple regression models to predict laptop prices. \
**Model Evaluation:** Comprehensive evaluation of model performance using appropriate metrics. \
**Overfitting Detection and Mitigation:** Strategies to address and reduce overfitting in models. 

## Getting Started
Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook and the necessary Python libraries installed. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. Start with the EDA.ipynb notebook to understand the dataset, followed by Project_regression.ipynb for the predictive modeling part.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, plotly

## Usage
Exploratory Data Analysis: Open EDA.ipynb to explore the dataset through interactive visualizations. Understand the data distribution, outliers, and relationships between features.
Regression Analysis: Proceed to Project_regression.ipynb for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improving the EDA, enhancing model performance, or any other enhancements, please feel free to contribute.
